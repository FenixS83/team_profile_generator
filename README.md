  ## Goals

  To create a team profile generator that would use the command line to collect and populate the data as needed.  

  ## Motivation

  Learning and becoming familiar with command line applications will only serve to benefit me in the long run.  

  ## Usage

  Generates a webpage that displays basic information for the individuals on a team. It allows for quick access to names, email address, employee id numbers, github usernames and schools

  ## Installation
  
  npm i     followed by       node index.js  

  ## Test

  npm run test

  ## Problems

  Compared against a number of other tests, my tests seem to be coded correctly and yet I have continued to struggle with getting them to function correctly. 

  ## Visualization

 ![The Team Profile Generator has a red banner across the top of the page with the title written in white in the center.The individual employee cards should appear as a white card with blue heading, all with black text listing name, role, employee id number, email address, office number, github username and school.](./assets/images/team_profile_generator.png)
